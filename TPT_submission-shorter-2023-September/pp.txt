One regular difficulty in a class on Energy and Social Policy is the wide variety
of units used by different technologists (BTU’s, Barrels of oil, Quads, kWh, etc).
Food is a great source of energy, everyone eats, so I think some of this confusion
can be resolved by starting and grounding the class with a discussion of food
and food production.

When the United States entered World War One one of the problems they
faced was logistics. How much food do you need to ship overseas to Europe
to feed a million soldiers? That early work in nutrition led to the 3000 Calorie
diet many people remember from secondary Health Education class. A reminder
about “Calorie” (uppercase) vs “calorie” (lowercase) units you might remember:
1 Calorie = 1 kilocalorie = 1kcal, and a dietitian might build a 3000kcal diet
for a 20 year old basketball player. One calorie = 0.001kcal, the amount of
energy it takes to heat a gram of water by a degree Celsius. There are about
4.2 Joules in a single calorie, and a Joule occurs all over introductory physics.
If you need to buy a new home furnace, the sales brochure might advertise that
it is capable of delivering 100, 000 BTU’s of heat each hour. What’s a BTU?
Heat a pound of water by 1◦F . Of course Heat Pumps are far more efficient
than simply burning methane or propane, but they consume kilo-watt-hours
(kWh) of electricity, not BTU’s. What’s a kWh? Run a 1000 Watt toaster
for an hour and you’ll have pulled one kWh off the grid, it will cost you about
$0.13 in Minnesota. If you decide to put solar panels in your backyard, they will
probably collect about 10% of the 3.5kW h the the sun delivers to each square
meter of your lawn (in Minnesota) each day.

As the previous paragraph illustrates, there are a frustratingly large number
of different units in an “Energy” class. At Winona State, this 3 credit class
fulfills a “Science and Social Policy” general education requirement and is taken
by students from across the university. Lots of college majors don’t require
a math class beyond algebra or introductory statistics and the population is
largely math-averse. You could jokingly say that one of the main things students

1

learn in the class is unit conversion, but it isn’t far off. Nearly every field finds
energy a useful representation, and every profession has their own set of units
and terminology most well suited for quick calculation. Would a medical lab
scientist talk about the fractional acre-foot of urine needed test kidney function?
No, but someone in the central valley of California would certainly care about
the acre-feet of water necessary to grow almonds! Does a gas station price their
gasoline in dollars per kWh? Given the growing electrification of cars, they
might soon.

Everyone eats, maybe not 3000kcals per day, but at least something every
day. When I teach our energy class, (Kraushaar et al., 2022; Muller, 2010), I
spend a few weeks talking about food energy before all other types - an overview
of that introduction is given in ??. While food production is not central to
climate change and wars over oil, food is essential in a way that diesel and
gasoline are not. Vehicle fuel makes modern life possible, but we could live,
unpleasantly, without it. We can’t live without fats and protein.

1.1 Where does food energy come from?

One feature of the aught’s “homesteading” culture1 is the idea that a person
should probably be able to move to the country, eat a lot of peaches, and
grow all their own food. Learning that farming labor is skilled labor can be
brutal and disheartening. Eating 3000kcals each day means planting, weeding,
harvesting, and storing more than a million kcals each year. (Haspel, 2015)
Where will those Calories come from? Is your backyard enough to homestead
in the suburbs?(Madigan, 2009)

At some point between 1920 and 1950, US chemical manufacturers realized
that in the post-war period, they could repurpose processes developed for man-
ufacturing munitions and chemical warfare agents, to produce chemicals that
would kill insects and increase the nitrogen levels in the soil. As figures 1 and
2 show, the epoch of “Better Living Through Chemistry” produced a dramatic
increase in per-acre yields across all commodity food crops, particularly corn
and potatoes.

However, if you’re discussing backyard Calorie production it isn’t reasonable
to use modern yield estimates for planning. “Roundup Ready” Corn, Soybean,
and Sugar Beet seeds are not readily available to the public, nobody wants to
put on a respirator to apply Atrazine ten feet from the back door, and the edge
effects from deer and insects are much smaller on a 600 acre field than they are
in an community garden allotment. In 1917 the USDA published a pamphlet
(Cooper & Spillman, 1917) giving detailed Calorie estimates a farmer might
expect from a given acre of a crop. A table from this pamphlet is shown in
Figure 3. The pamphlet data came from pre-war, pre-chemical agriculture, and
the yields cited were produced with horses, manure, lime, and large families full
of children. If you want to be self sufficient, these yield numbers are probably
a good upper bound on what’s realistically possible by a dedicated Luddite.

1See for example, the Discover television show, “Alaska the Last Frontier,” any issue of

“Mother Earth News,” or Backyard Chicken feeds on Instagram.

Figure 1: USDA per acre Corn and Potato production figures, plotted over
time. Data is given in harvest units, 56lbs bushels per acre for field corn and
hundred-weight (CWT) for potatoes. By mass, corn is about 4.5 times more
calorie dense than potato which results in a nearly equal kcal/acre values for
both crops in figure 2. Details on the data source and conversions are given in
??.

So, another question using this data.

If you want to feed your family of
four people potatoes, how much land will you need to cultivate? Here’s an
estimate: a family of 4 requires 3000kcal/person each day.2 If we over-estimate
and produce food for the entire year, the family will need about 4.4 million
kcals.

is the USDA reference for an “average adult,” e.g. the author, in his 40’s, and 1000 − 1200kcal
for a senior age (> 60) female. However, weeding the garden all day is physically taxing, mice
will probably eat some of the potatoes, and 3000 is a nice round number, so that’s what I’m
using.

duction data is scaled by estimated dietary kcal content to show that, over all
crops, there has been a dramatic increase in kcal production since about 1940.
Details of the data source and conversions are given in ??. The idea for this plot
came from an online blog. (Biegert, 2017) It would be interesting to know if
there are patterns of scaling among vegetable families (grains, legumes, tubers,
etc) in the same way that there are family classifications for the minimal energy
required for transport. (Tucker, 1975)

What does the answer of 2.3 acres mean? The university’s 91m × 49m
football field has an area of about 1.1 acres, so you could say that a foot-
ball field planted in potatoes will probably feed a family through the winter.
(Deppe, 2020) Can a person enjoy the benefits of urban living and grow all
their own food? The population density of New Jersey is 1, 263 people/mile2 ≈
1.97 people/acre and our 4 person family needs 2.3 acres for their potatoes.
Unless the social model is one of a country Dacha or an endless suburb with
no duplexes or apartment buildings, urban living and food self-sufficiency seem
mutually exclusive.

More emotionally charged conversations can be had about converting the
United States to all organic agriculture, which, for corn, typically has a yield
penalty of about 20 − 40bu/acre when compared to conventional production.
The 1917 data isn’t directly applicable, but it relates. At 180bu/acre conven-

feed the US population (350 million people) corn for a year. The remainder of
the corn belt can be devoted to animal feed, ethanol, and export. If the corn
belt was devoted to producing organic corn at lower yield, (Delate et al., 1998)
we probably wouldn’t starve, but cheap meat and ethanol vehicle fuel would
likely disappear.

2 Example: How big could Tenochtitlan have

been?

The questions described thus far have largely been centered within a physics
context. The paper closes with two more examples that leverage this food
energy picture to make historical claims. The first example relates to the pre-
Colombian capital of the Aztec Empire, Tenochtitlan, now known as Mexico
City. Tenochtitlan was built on and around a endorheic lake, Texcoco. Crops
were grown in shallow parts of the lake via chinampas, (Borunda & Rodriguez,
2022) floating patches of decaying vegetation and soil. Given the proximity to
water and decaying vegetation, these fields were very fertile (Coe, 1964; Ebel,
2019) and some continue to be used in the present day.3

Estimates of Tenochtitlan’s population in 1500CE vary widely, from 40,000
(Evans, 2013, p549) to more than 400,000 inhabitants (Britannica, 2022), com-
parable in size to Paris at that time. These estimates come from oral and written
records and estimates of archaeological building density and land area. While
cannibalism was part of Aztec religious ritual and practice, (Ortiz de Montel-
lano, 1978), the staple Calorie sources for the Aztecs were corn and beans.

Few if any Native American cultures made use of draft animals for food
or power before the Colombian Exchange. This means that the food that fed
Tenochtitlan must have been brought to the city center by foot or canoe. How
much land must have been devoted to chinampas to feed the population, or
conversely, how many people could be supported by the land within walking or
paddling distance from the city center?

A 1964 paper in Scientific American (Coe, 1964) gives a general outline of
the chinampas in the area of Tenochtitlan in 1500CE. This map, shown in figure
4 seems to be the basis for the similar figure in Wikipedia. (File:Lake Texcoco c
1519.png, 2016) Descriptions of chinampas agriculture indicate that as many as
7 successive crops could be grown and harvested from the same plot of soil each
year, two of which could be maize (corn). This is truly amazing productivity,
given that in the midwest United States corn is normally grown, at most, every
other year because of its extreme nutrient demands on the soil.

There are many ways to approach this estimation problem. We could assume
a Tenochtitlan population of 100, 000 people has a 3000kcal/day diet that comes
completely from corn. Assuming that corn’s density and nutritional content

3Chinampas are still visible in satellite imagery. See for example latitude = 19.268,

longitude = −99.087.

haven’t changed in the 4 centuries preceding the 1917 data in figure 3, we could
assume 1lbs of corn contains ≈ 1594kcal of food energy. Looking at the map
with ImageJ, (Schneider et al., 2012) it seems like the recorded area devoted
to chinampas might be about 16, 000 acres. With these assumptions, we could
equate the corn energy production from chinampas with the population’s yearly
food need. Note, in this version of the story, the corn productivity, P bu
acre is
treated as an unknown variable.

This crop productivity is in remarkable agreement with the 1917 USDA
yields, 35bu/acre, which seems to validate the assumed 100, 000 person popula-
tion of Tenochtitlan. Some references (Coe, 1964) describe an extensive tribute
system that Aztec government required of its subjects, which certainly would
have been necessary to support populations on the upper end of historical esti-
mates. (Britannica, 2022)

Figure 3: A table from a USDA booklet giving 1917 yields for various farm
products. The amounts listed were almost certainly produced via only animal
and human power with only manure and lime available as chemical soil amend-
ments. Accordingly, they are probably a reasonable upper bound on what’s
possible in a modern “back to the land” backyard garden.

3 Example: Was the Irish Potato Famine a Nat-

ural Disaster?

In contrast to native cultures of the Americas, Ireland’s population boomed
(Fagan,
with the Colombian Exchange and the introduction of the potato.
2001; Salaman & Hawkes, 1985) Figure 5 shows that from about 1700 onward
there was a dramatic growth in the island’s population. There’s never just
one reason for historical events, but unlike grains, potatoes thrived in Ireland’s
cool damp climate. Potatoes, kale, and milk form a nutritionally complete diet
that greatly reduced hunger-related mortality among the poor working-class in
Ireland. If you look closely at the data in figure 5 you might believe that there
were two weather and potato related famines, the most obvious 1845-49 and
the second, with much smaller effect on population in 1740-1. Both famines
were precipitated by poor weather, but an important difference is that in 1740,
Ireland was a sovereign state but by 1845 the island was effectively an economic
colony of the British Empire. (Fagan, 2001)

As the story goes, the two main commodity crops in Ireland were potatoes
(for humans), and oats, which as horse feed, were something like gasoline in
today’s economy. A sovereign government can halt the export of food to feed
English horses, which is what happened in 1741 (and 1782). The grain was
diverted back as relief to starving people in Ireland, reducing the famine’s mor-
tality. However, by 1845 most of Irish farmland was economically controlled
by foreign (English) markets, and grain traders typically refused to divert oats
(horse feed) as famine relief for the sake of their investment income.

This inflammatory claim, which is certainly a simplified version of history,
serves as a useful evaluation example for students. Specifically, in years that the
potato crop failed because of weather or late blight, could the amount of oats
produced (and exported) have fed the Irish population? More broadly, was the
Great Famine due to weather and disease, natural causes “we can’t do anything
about,” or was the depth of the tragedy a result of political choices?

Some estimates follow:

Ireland’s population in 1845 was about 8.5 mil-
lion people. The island has an area of about 84, 400km24 and you might es-
timate that 64% of the land (54, 000km2) is arable for agriculture. (Ask about
Ireland, 2023) It seems reasonable to use the 1917 productivity, figure 3, to
make calculations for Ireland in 1845. Reminder, in 1917, potatoes produced
1.908 × 106kcal/acre and oats 1.254 × 106kcal/acre. With students, evaluation
of the claim could be approached as a series of questions:

How much food does the island need?

f ood needed per year = 8.5 × 106 people ·

·

,

≈ 9.3 × 1012kcals.

4Currently, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are separate countries. Together,

their land area is about 84, 400km2.

(8)

Summed, 49, 700km2, these two areas devoted to oats and potatoes are
roughly equivalent to the amount of arable land estimated above for Ireland,
54, 000km2. (Ask about Ireland, 2023) What do the numbers mean? Did there
have to be a famine? If all of the potato crop failed because of late blight, there
would likely have been enough oats to feed the population a 2000kcal ration of
oats with leftover to spare. Like the Holodomor or the Great Leap Forward, the
numbers suggest that large-scale suffering wasn’t a natural disaster, but rather
a human disaster resulting from poor government policy insensitive to the value
of human life.

4 Conclusion

A class about Energy and Social Policy and the author hasn’t mentioned climate
change, coal, or solar panels even once! What is he thinking?

How many tons of carbon does your car release in a year? How many
shiploads of iron oxide will we have to dump into the ocean for phytoplank-
ton to eat up the equivalent about of carbon? Every question in a class like this
is, to at least some extent, informed by numerical calculation and it is pretty ar-
rogant to assume that “those students” don’t need to (or can’t) do the math. If
you’re going to have success talking about numerical calculations, you might as
well start with examples that everyone can relate to, and everyone eats! Along
the way you might find fascinating historical questions to investigate.

The work was influenced and improved by discussions with Diane Dahle-

Koch, John Deming, Carl Ferkinhoff, Larry Moore, and Sarah Taber.

Figure 5:
The population of Ireland over time, file from Wikipedia.
(File:Population of the island of Ireland since 1600.png, 2010) The humble
potato, kale, and milk were part of an amazing population boom. Note that
there were two weather-related “potato” famines in Ireland, in about 1740 and
1850. Government policy response to the famines could explain the drastic
difference in subsequent population following each of the two famines. The pop-
ulation of Ireland finally re-reached its 1851 peak in 2021. (Carroll, 2021)
